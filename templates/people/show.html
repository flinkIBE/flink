	     There shouldn't be any hardcoded elements here.
	     All elements must be carefully added via jQuery and kept track of.
	     When an element is added or removed, their unique, randomly generated IDs
	     must be stored in javascript and regularly transmitted to the server
	     in an attempt to 'save' the current state of the elements.
	     All elements must be draggable, resizeable and extend properties that make
	     them editable.
