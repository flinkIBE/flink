Modify this list with updated information.

* Make rest of the models and forms.
* Add in functionality for orientation of images.
* Add functionality supporting addition of text elements.
* Defaults! And adjusting defaults and settings.
    * Grid size (gridArray variable in posterboards/show should not be hardcoded
      but should comprise template variables that are pulled from the DB).
    * Default layout
* User Home Page
    * On PB Creation, user adds it to a location on the home page.
    * Adjusting the content of the user home page (draggable, resizable).
        * Pretty much just dragging and resizing images.
    * One way would be to have a button on the PB that says 'render home page
      image' and this would generate the html of the page, create an image
      (dunno how lol, there are utilities that will generate an image though,
      google it).
    * Each posterboard is in a 'set'. A set is basically a posterboard of
      posterboards. On posterboard creation, it should be put in an appropriate
      set. If a set is full, it should go to the next set. The blogger can change
      which set posterboards appear in. 
* Comments    
* Details
   * Timestamps for posterboards
   * LOTS of validation... what if a user tries adding 50 objects to a posterboard?
     We should limit that right? Refer to the design doc and spec. What if the user
     tries making the grid size 1x1 pixels... that's not good, neither is 500x500 pixels.
* Web page styling
   * Right now, the website looks pretty ugly. It needs to look much better.
   * Make posterboard page shinier. Editing toolbar needs to look better.
   * Header and footer especially.
