Modify this list with updated information.

* Make rest of the models and forms.
* Add in functionality for orientation of images.
* Defaults! And adjusting defaults and settings.
    * Grid size (gridArray variable in posterboards/show should not be hardcoded
      but should comprise template variables that are pulled from the DB).
    * Default layout
* User Home Page
    * On PB Creation, user adds it to a location on the home page.
* Comments    
* Details
   * Timestamps for posterboards
   * LOTS of validation... what if a user tries adding 50 objects to a 
     posterboard? We should limit that right? Refer to the design doc and spec.
     What if the user tries making the grid size 1x1 pixels... that's not good,
     neither is 500x500 pixels.
   * Use Amazon S3 to store content such as images, audio, video and retrieve 
     the content properly.
      * Use django plugins to help with this, or their native implementation 
      	that helps interface with S3 and stuff.
   * To preserve privacy, there must be a directory for each user's content,
     rather than a shared one for all content, and this should be hashed,
     with a second level of hashes for the actual posterboard, so as to 
     preserve privacy of private posterboards. Use a secret key hashed with 
     user id and posterboard id.
* Web page styling
   * Right now, the website looks pretty ugly. It needs to look much better.
   * Make posterboard page shinier. Editing toolbar needs to look better.
   * Header and footer especially.
* Patch vlprocess for pad options.
* Patch django_cron for syncdb errors.
